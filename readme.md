# Unlock Hidden BIOS Settings & Unbrick Lenovo Legions BIOS (2025)
* This is a personal guide that i created for myself and to help others with the same problems i had.
* I'm using a LENOVO LEGION 5 15ACH6A for reference, but should be the same in others.

## ADVANCED BIOS SETTINGS
Usually Hidden BIOS Settings should appear with a key combination, this laptop doesn't.
So we gonna use a USB Pendrive in order to force-it.

First, download the bootable iso. [DOWNLOAD](https://github.com/Thomashighbaugh/Lenovo-Legion-Advanced-Bios/releases/download/v0.0.1/lenovo_legion_advanced_bios.iso)  [MIRROR](https://github.com/gzmatte/lenovolegion/releases/download/1/lenovo_legion_advanced_bios-backup.iso)

Now, install it to your pendrive via [RUFUS](https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/releases/download/v3.18/rufus-3.18.exe)

Once ready, restart your PC and enable in your BIOS "USB BOOT" and Disable "Secure Boot".
